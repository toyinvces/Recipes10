The myRecipes app is intended as a way to collect favorite food recipes in one app. The final product will be able to collect recipes from many sources. However as a test, this app only collects recipes from the yummly.com service. The user can search recipes to cook, for example “soup” and receive a list of results. The users can then scroll the list and view details of the recipe that caught their eye. Once they have found a recipe they like, they can save it to their recipes list. When on the “saved recipes list”  the user can select a recipe and a new window will open where the user can view details of the recipe such as ingredients and instructions. As a unique feature of this app, the user can run a timer while reading the details of the recipe. This can help with keeping time of the different tasks that are involved on cooking the recipe.
